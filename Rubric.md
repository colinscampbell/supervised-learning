Data Preprocessing
The submission does all of the following:

✓ Data is correctly split into a training and test set.
✓ Categorical features are converted to numeric with get_dummies
✓ Missing categorical features in the testing data are filled in programmatically
✓ Data is scaled with StandardScaler.


Reflection and Reporting
The submission does all of the following: 

✓ Makes a prediction on which model will perform better on the unscaled data. The prediction is made with adequate justification. (Note: no points are removed for predictions that prove to be incorrect)
✓ Makes a prediction on which model will perform better on the scaled data. The prediction is made with adequate justification. (Note: no points are removed for predictions that prove to be incorrect).
✓ Makes a comparison between predicted behavior of the models on unscaled data and the actual results.
✓ Makes a comparison between predicted behavior of the models on scaled data and the actual results.
